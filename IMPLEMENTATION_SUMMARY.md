  - `teacher_answer_key_template.tex` - Solutions with pedagogical guidance
  - `extension_activity_template.tex` - Advanced activities and investigations

### ‚úÖ 2. Automated Quality Assurance System

- **Completeness Checker** (`check_lesson_completeness.sh`): Verifies all 5 required files exist for each lesson
- **Progress Tracker** (`progress_tracker.sh`): Visual progress bars, milestones, and recommendations
- **File Organization Tool** (`organize_files.sh`): Checks naming conventions and directory structure

### ‚úÖ 3. Development Workflow Tools

- **Template Customizer** (`customize_template.sh`): Quickly creates customized files from templates
- **Lesson Set Creator** (`create_lesson_set.sh`): Creates complete 5-file lesson sets in one command
- **Quality Standards Enforcement**: Automated checks for consistency and completeness

### ‚úÖ 4. Master Documentation System

- **Master Index** (`MASTER_INDEX.md`): Complete navigation for all 150 planned lessons
- **Development Roadmap** (`DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`): Strategic 28-week development plan
- **Updated File Management System**: Aligned with actual syllabi from all folders

### ‚úÖ 5. Lesson Development Progress

- **Mathematics**: 6 complete lesson sets (13% of 46 total)
  - ‚úÖ Lesson 01: Number Operations
  - ‚úÖ Lesson 02: Place Value
  - ‚úÖ Lesson 03: Number Properties
  - ‚úÖ Lesson 04: Number Patterns
  - ‚úÖ Lesson 05: Roman Numerals
  - ‚úÖ Lesson 06: Rounding
- **Non-Verbal Reasoning**: 1 complete lesson set (5% of 18 total)
  - ‚úÖ Lesson 01: Shape Puzzles

## üéØ Next Steps (Ready to Execute)

### Immediate Priorities (Week 1-2)

1. **Complete MA Numbers Unit**: 6 remaining lessons (07-12)

   ```bash
   ./scripts/create_lesson_set.sh MA 07 WordProblems
   ./scripts/create_lesson_set.sh MA 08 FractionsDecimalsPercentages
   # Continue for lessons 09-12
   ```

2. **Expand NVR Unit 1**: 4 remaining lessons (02-05)
   ```bash
   ./scripts/create_lesson_set.sh NVR 02 Similarities
   ./scripts/create_lesson_set.sh NVR 03 OddOneOut
   # Continue for lessons 04-05
   ```

### Development Workflow (Established)

```bash
# Daily development routine:
# 1. Create new lesson set
./scripts/create_lesson_set.sh [SUBJECT] [NUM] [TOPIC]

# 2. Edit template placeholders with actual content
# 3. Check progress
./scripts/progress_tracker.sh

# 4. Verify completeness
./scripts/check_lesson_completeness.sh
```
